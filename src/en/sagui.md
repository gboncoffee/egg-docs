# Sagui

Sagui is a fantasy 8 bit RISC architecture created by Dr. Marco Zanata,
professor at Universidade Federal do Paran√°. The implementation in EGG has one
extension: a instruction `movr r0, r0` is actually interpreted as a BREAK system
call.

It uses the standard Assembly syntax. It's assembler is very dumb, tho. It'll
not fix any relative-addressed immediate, so basically you're on your own to
compute all jumps manually. Good luck.
